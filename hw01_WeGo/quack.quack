The most riveting adventure with my duckie (Bill) was when I was working on the transpose function in a previous homework with a matrix. After planning out a procedure that I thought would work, I decided to code it. After implementing it into code, I found out that the final product was not the one I was looking for. This puzzled me, or more accurately, it irritated me. "Why did my plan fail?" I thought to myself. After looking at my KTS multiple times, I still could not find a solution. This is where I took out Bill and described to him the procedure step by step. This is where I realized my error. By explaining each step, I had realized that each item is swapped twice. After a few more minutes, I had a working method. This was an important experience to me beacuse it taught me how to find possible bugs and to remain calm. I owe it to Bill for keeping me focused and productive.
